# Data Management Plan (DMP) Template

Creating a Data Management Plan (DMP) is often a time-consuming and
tedious task for researchers, especially for those unfamiliar with
data management requirements or best practices. Many researchers are
unsure about what information to include, how detailed it should be,
or how to structure the document according to the expectations of
funding agencies or institutions.

This repository provides a clear and concise example of a DMP to help
researchers write their own quickly and efficiently. The goal is not
to provide a one-size-fits-all document, but to offer a structured
starting point that can be easily adapted to a wide range of
scientific projects.
